Makerspace IoT is a sub-project of the Smart^3 Makerspaces Vertically Integrated Project, aiming to digitalize and provide actionable insights for machines in the Flowers Invention Studio.

This is achieved using sensors which continuously collect data on various parameters (current, vibration, temperature) for a machine. The project aims to create a one-of-a-kind low-cost, scalable IoT infrastructure which aids in the predictive maintenance of the machinery.

This wiki provides live documentation of the resources utilized in the project.
