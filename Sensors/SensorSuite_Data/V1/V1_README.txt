Steps taken to get V1 Data:

Machine data is collected from the wood sanding machine at the Invention Studio.
NOTE: Beginning of dataset might have some random disturbance due to intial setup onto sanding machine bedding.

1. Sensors is turned on before its attachment to the sanding machine bed. (No Change) (Not sure)
2. Sensor is attached to sanding machine bed, but machine is still turned off. (Random Data) (Not Sure)
3. Vacuum of the sanding machine is turned on, but the sanding machine itself is not on. (Slight Spike Up)
4. Machine is turned on, but no wooden block has been sanded yet. (Spike Up)
5. Wooden block is being sanded. (Spike Up)
6. Wooden block is released from being sanded (Spike Down)
7. Machine and vacuum is turned off (Curve Down)
